# comp-methods-practice
This repository contains code for tasks on the subject "**Computational methods and computational practicum**" 
## Tasks
1. [Numerical methods for solving nonlinear equations](https://github.com/egor-shishkarev/comp-methods-practice/tree/main/NonlinearEquations) - This task involves finding the odd roots of nonlinear equations by the following methods: **1) Bisection method**, **2) Newton's method (tangent method)**, **3) Modified Newton's method**, **4) Secant method**
2. [The problem of algebraic interpolation. An interpolation polynomial in the Lagrange form](https://github.com/egor-shishkarev/comp-methods-practice/tree/main/AlgebraicInterpolation) - This task involves finding the approximate value of a function at a point using the **Lagrange interpolation polynomial**
3. [Finding derivatives of a tabulated function using numerical differentiation formulas](https://github.com/egor-shishkarev/comp-methods-practice/tree/main/NumericalDifferentiation) - This task includes calculating derivatives for a tabulated function and clarifying their values using the **Runge-Romberg method**
